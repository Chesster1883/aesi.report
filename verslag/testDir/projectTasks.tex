\subsection{What is powerful behavior for a single bot?}
We want to answer this question, because we need it to create the genotype of the bots. There are various ways to find out what powerful behavior is. We are going to answer this question by doing internet research, using RoboResearch and by studying the result of the RoboCode with JGAP program.

\subsection{How can powerful behavior be generated}
To answer this question we will make our own genetic algorithm using JGAP. We will use RoboResearch to benchmark how our robot is better. In the end we want to see our own robot, generated by genetic programming, win.

\subsection{What is powerful behavior for a team of bots?}
We want to answer this question for the same reason as for single bots. The only problem may be finding good teams online, because the main focus of the program still lies on 1 vs 1 bot fights.

\subsection{How can powerful team behavior be generated using genetic programming?}
If we find enough time, we will focus on creating powerful teams the same way as creating our robots, with genetic algorithms. In the end we want to see our genetically created team winning from other teams.
